## üìñ How to Use

### 1. Patient Triage Assessment
1. **Patient Information**: Enter name, age, and gender
2. **Symptom Assessment**: Use the intuitive sliders and dropdowns to assess:
   - Primary symptoms (pain level, breathing, consciousness)
   - Cardiovascular symptoms (chest pain, heart rhythm)
   - Neurological symptoms (headache, confusion)
   - Critical signs (bleeding, temperature)
3. **Additional Information**: Add medical history and other symptoms
4. **Submit**: Get instant AI-powered priority assessment

### 2. Queue Management
- **View Statistics**: Monitor total patients, critical cases, and average wait times
- **Patient Queue**: See all patients ordered by priority with estimated wait times
- **Critical Alerts**: Receive immediate notifications for critical patients

### 3. Medical Assistant
- **Ask Questions**: Chat with the AI about symptoms, procedures, and medical guidance
- **Quick Actions**: Use predefined buttons for common topics
- **Emergency Help**: Get immediate guidance for emergency situations

## üß† Triage Algorithm

### Priority Levels
| Priority | Label | Wait Time | Description |
|----------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Critical - Immediate | 0 min | Life-threatening conditions |
| 2 | High - Within 15 min | 15 min | Urgent conditions |
| 3 | Moderate - Within 30 min | 30 min | Serious but stable |
| 4 | Low - Within 60 min | 60 min | Less urgent conditions |
| 5 | Minimal - Within 120 min | 120 min | Non-urgent conditions |

### Assessment Factors
- **Symptom Severity**: Pain level, breathing difficulty, consciousness level
- **Age Factor**: Enhanced priority for pediatric and geriatric patients
- **Vital Signs**: Heart rate, blood pressure, temperature
- **Critical Conditions**: Bleeding, chest pain, neurological symptoms
- **Risk Factors**: Medical history and comorbidities

### Fuzzy Logic Implementation
The system uses advanced fuzzy logic with:
- **Triangular Membership Functions**: For symptom severity assessment
- **Trapezoidal Membership Functions**: For boundary conditions
- **Sigmoid Functions**: For smooth transitions between priority levels
- **Rule-based Inference**: Combines multiple symptoms for final assessment
